# Tri 1 Homework Summation Blog

This page summarizes each Tri 1 JavaScript homework with a short note on what was learned and a link to the notebook for the full exercise.

---

**Arrays (what I learned):** I practiced creating, accessing, and modifying arrays, and used loops to process array elements (sum, average, find min/max).

---

**Data Abstraction (what I learned):** I learned how abstractions (functions and classes) hide implementation details and simplify using complex behavior; practiced writing and using simple functions and class methods.

---

**JSON and JavaScript Objects (what I learned):** I learned the difference between JavaScript objects and JSON, how to stringify and parse JSON, and when to use each format for data transfer vs in-code data structures.

---

**Booleans (what I learned):** I practiced boolean values and logical operators, used comparisons to create conditions, and wrote checks combining multiple boolean expressions.

---

**Mathematical Expressions (what I learned):** I practiced arithmetic operators, order of operations, modulo to test divisibility, and building simple expression-based programs.

---

**Nested Conditionals (what I learned):** I learned how to place conditionals inside other conditionals to express multi-step decisions and practiced using nested checks across loops and objects.

---

**Strings (what I learned):** I practiced string operations: measuring length, accessing first/last characters, and concatenating strings to form sentences.

---

**Iterations (Instructor note):** I taught the Iterations lesson for this unit (I instructed the class on loops and iterative patterns used throughout these homeworks).
